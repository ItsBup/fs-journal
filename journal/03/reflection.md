# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
MVC seemed very daunting. At the start of this week I had absolutely no clue what I was looking at. By the end of the week, I feel somewhat confident in the basic layout and felt good about what I was able to accomplish during the afternoon labs.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I did not understand why you would invest into MVC given how complex it looked at first. As I learned more and practiced with it I began to realize how potentially helpful it could be working on larger scale projects.
- What are you struggling with?
Group lab efforts remain a struggle for me. Maybe its the reduced amount of control over the project, maybe it's the social anxiety, who can say.
- What would you count as a victory?
Mick laughed at my croc vendr lab.
