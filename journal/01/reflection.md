# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    made a cool little toad site and took care of my journal questions right away instead of procrastinating them. 
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    crocs have been up to some weird shenanigans.
- What are you struggling with?
    i am not confident in my ability to navigate/utilize github at the moment. i know it's probably just a learning curve, but it's annoying me nonetheless.
- What would you count as a victory?
    i got to utilize a lot of the html & css i had previously self taught myself this summer while i was making the cool little toad site. made me happy because i was nervous i'd accidentally brain-dumped everything. but no, looks like it kinda is like riding a bike :D
