# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git helps manage a program, allowing multiple developers to utilize it without issue.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > creates a new directory. "Trailblazes"

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > Pseudo-Class is a common Selector. the most used example i've seen is ':hover' so i assume i'll be using that one a lot.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > specificity determines which out of multiple commands will take priority and actually be executed.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > it'll actually brute force its way to top priority and will overwrite other input commands. using multiple of these sounds like your asking for errors.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > Selector, Property, Value

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > users are more likely to have positive association with your project if the design is 'palatable'. in addition, you can subtly guide users to view certain things, or understand principles of your project through use of color and weight.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > creates a blueprint of an initial product concept, effectively mapping out a plan for the developers and other involved parties.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > absolutely. the effort you spend in conceptualizing is well worth the time you potentially save later. nothing i hate more than doing lots of work only for someone to tell me i was working on something that didn't need doing/is wrong and now needs to be changed.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > flex is the divine avenger that allows you to easily and intuitively arrange a given layout.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > height, width, padding, margin all mess with that box size
