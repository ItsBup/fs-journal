# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
I had a wonderful time with my group for group projects this week. I normally dread the group assignments but this one was efficient, enlightening, and dare I say it, enjoyable.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
I was expecting the difficulty to ramp up this week after last week. And it did, just not in the way I was expecting. I was expecting the newly introduced concepts to be difficult, but things seemed pretty straightforward in the lectures. It wasn't till I got to executing the code when all the whacky weird stuff happened.
- What are you struggling with?
This week's struggle was with unrecognized errors. Most of which where my fault, some select few were not and threw me for an absolute loop. This week was especially run on the afternoon labs because of this. It is strange, because I think I understand the assignments and the teachings, but whenever I actually sat down to code this week things got whack quick. Call me Oppenheimer the way my code randomly detonating.
- What would you count as a victory?
This week's group lab assignment was absolutely a positive in my book. However, 1st place victory goes to my performance in Cats UPS tho. Super proud of all 69 of those deliveries ðŸ«¡
